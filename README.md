## 🪣 Public S3 Bucket (ECMWF)

Datasets are publicly available via ECMWF’s S3 bucket 's3://ecmwf-rodeo-benchmark', as approved for open access.

For instance in python: 
``` python
import zarr
zarr.open('https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/ecmwf-rodeo-benchmark/seeps4all/obs_seeps_tp24_2022_2024_ecad.zarr')
```

### ECAD / SEEPS4ALL
- Format: **Zarr**
- Preprocessed for use in verification workflows

### OPERA 
Total Precipitation (TP) datasets containing:
- **TP** (total precipitation)
- **QI** (quality indicator)
- **DM** (Data mask)

Available configurations:
- **6-hour aggregated** TP at:
  - N320 resolution
  - O96 resolution
- **1-hour aggregated** TP at:
  - N320 resolution
  - O96 resolution
- **1-hour native-resolution** TP (no reprojection)

## 📚 Getting Started

Each dataset-specific repository includes:
- A detailed `README.md` with variable descriptions
- Python notebooks or scripts showing how to:
  - Load datasets
  - Use the data in ML pipelines (e.g. Anemoi)
  - Apply the data in forecast verification contexts (e.g. SEEPS score computation)
