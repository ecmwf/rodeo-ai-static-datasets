## Verification notebooks for assessing daily precipitation forecasts 

Computation of scores using climate statisic + plotting

---


Verification notebooks using SEEPS4ALL datasets as input (hese  notebooks can be run in parallel):
- [notebook_1_verif_single](https://github.com/ecmwf/rodeo-ai-static-datasets/blob/seeps/seeps4all/verification/notebook_1_verif_single_seeps.ipynb) for the verification of single deterministic forecast with SEEPS.

- [notebook_2_verif_single_climate](https://github.com/ecmwf/rodeo-ai-static-datasets/blob/seeps/seeps4all/verification/notebook_2_verif_single_climate.ipynb) for the verification of single deterministic forecast using climate statistics.

- [notebook_3_verif_single_dressed](https://github.com/ecmwf/rodeo-ai-static-datasets/blob/seeps/seeps4all/verification/notebook_3_verif_single_dressed.ipynb) for the verification of single deterministic forecast after dressing with probabilistic scores.
